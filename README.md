# BlackHole
## Presentation
This project uses Newtonian Equations of classical mecanics to approximate the influence of a Black Hole.
Each photon is considered as a moving particule, influenced by Gravitational forces. The simulation uses Euler formulas to solve the problem's ODEs.

## Libraries and dependencies
This project uses C++ and SFML to handle graphics.
